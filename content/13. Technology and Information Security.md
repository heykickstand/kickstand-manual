#### Disaster Recovery Plan
1. **Identify and prioritize critical assets:** The first step is to identify the critical assets that are necessary for the business to operate. This includes client data, marketing collateral, financial records, and other important files. Then prioritize the assets based on their importance to the business.
2. **Backup critical data:** It is essential to backup all critical data regularly. All working files are stored on Dropbox or Google Drive, depending on the type of file. All sensitive or critical files are backed up locally to a hard drive then replicated remotely..
3. **Develop a communication plan:** In the event of a disaster, it's essential to have a communication plan in place. This includes a list of all employees' contact information and alternative contact information for each employee. We will also utilize our team Slack for more visible communication.
4. **Establish a disaster recovery team:** It's important to establish a disaster recovery team consisting of employees from different departments. The team should be responsible for executing the disaster recovery plan and ensuring that all critical assets are restored. Matt Bull will be responsible for coordinating communications and Bo Bartlett will be responsible for restoring any lost data, equipment, or other work tools.
5. **Test the disaster recovery plan:** It's crucial to test the disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure that it's effective. This can be done through simulated disaster scenarios or tabletop exercises. This will help identify any weaknesses in the plan and allow you to make necessary adjustments.
6. **Document the disaster recovery plan**: It's essential to document the disaster recovery plan, including all procedures and protocols. This should be easily accessible to all employees so that everyone is aware of what to do in the event of a disaster. This plan is documented and stored in our team Notion.
